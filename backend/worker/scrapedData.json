  "summary": "The Future of AI: How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the World\nAI is constantly changing our world. Here are just a few ways AI will influence our lives.\n\nThe Evolution of AI\nAI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.\nSince then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.\nAI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization.\n\n\nImproved Business Automation\nAbout 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.\nAI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.\n“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”\nMORE ON AI\n75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know\n\n\nJob Disruption\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\nWorkers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.\n“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.\n\n\nData Privacy Issues\nCompanies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.\nIn response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\n\n\nIncreased Regulation\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.\nEthical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.\n\n\nClimate Change Concerns\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.\nAt the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\n\n\nWhat Industries Will AI Impact the Most?\nThere’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.\n\nAI in Manufacturing\nManufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.\n\n\nAI in Healthcare\nIt may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants.\n\n\nAI in Finance\nBanks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions.\n\n\nAI in Education\nAI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.\n\n\nAI in Media\nJournalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.\n\n\nAI in Customer Service\nMost people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n\nAI in Transportation\nTransportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.\n\n\nRisks and Dangers of AI\nDespite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.\n\nJob Losses\nBetween 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.\n\n\nHuman Biases\nThe reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\n\n\nDeepfakes and Misinformation\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\n\n\nData Privacy\nTraining AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.\n\n\nAutomated Weapons\nThe use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.\n\n\nSuperior Intelligence\nNightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur.\n“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”\n\n5 trends in artificial intelligence\nHere are the AI trends expected to be seen in 2024.\n\n1. Generative AI and democratization\nGenerative AI is arguably the biggest trend in AI this year. When ChatGPT and other text and image generators became accessible to the general public, it was widely used and adopted by business teams worldwide. Along with this is the democratization of AI, enabling it to be available to everyone—even those without technical knowledge.\nRead more: How To Write ChatGPT Prompts: Your 2024 Guide\nGenerative AI is just one example of democratization. Hundreds of AI tools today allow us to create content faster, translate between languages, and populate search engines. It is changing how we communicate with each other, whether it’s between friends or between the media and the general public.\n\n2. AI for workplace productivity\nAnother trend we see in AI is its place in workplace productivity. Artificial intelligence can speed up and enhance how we work—in particular, how it automates time-consuming or repetitive tasks. Whether inputting data in a spreadsheet, writing an outline for a business plan, or controlling quality at a manufacturing plant, AI has massive potential to increase our productivity at work.\nFor those who may be concerned about AI replacing jobs, this technology is often simply acting as a tool for automating repetition, leaving room for humans to make space for creativity, emotional intelligence, and moral judgment.\n\n3. Multimodal AI\nMany large language models (LLMs) process only text data. Multimodel models in AI can grasp information from different data types, like audio, video, and images, in addition to text. This technology is enabling search and content creation tools to become more seamless and intuitive and integrate more easily into other applications we already use.\nFor example, iPhones can now figure out who and what objects are in your photographs because they can process images, metadata text, and search data. Similar to how a human can look at a photo and identify what’s in it, multimodals enable that same characteristic.\n\n4. AI in science and health care\nBesides AI’s influence in the business workplace, AI tools have great potential in science and health care. Researchers, such as those at Microsoft, are now using AI to build tools to predict weather, estimate carbon emissions, and enable sustainable farming practices [3]. This trend aims to address and mitigate the effects of climate change.\nChatbots are being deployed in agriculture and health care, to help farmers identify a type of weed and to help medical professionals diagnose patients. While the accuracy of this AI is in progress, these steps can accelerate scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs.\nAI in computer science: AI has become an in-demand skill for computer science professionals. You can get ahead of the curve by learning to leverage an AI coding partner for efficiency with Microsoft's Copilot for Software Development Specialization:\n\n5. Regulation and ethics\nWith the proliferation of AI worldwide, the trend of mitigating any risks associated with AI is paramount. Government agencies and organizations like OpenAI are ensuring AI is used and deployed responsibly and ethically. In March 2024, the European Union debated a landmark comprehensive AI bill designed to regulate AI and address concerns for consumers. It is expected to become law this year.\nIf AI is not regulated, data manipulation, misinformation, bias, and privacy risks can arise and pose greater societal risks. For example, tools can be susceptible to discrimination or legal risk if AI doesn’t collect data representative of a population. Generators like ChatGPT pull information from internet searches worldwide, but companies and publications have sued OpenAI for copyright infringement.\nRead more: AI Ethics: What It Is and Why It Matters\n\nStart learning AI today\nEnroll in one of Coursera’s most popular courses AI for Everyone, from DeepLearning.AI.

These advanced algorithms uncover patterns that traditional algorithms might miss and excel at processing and making sense of enormous datasets. Deep learning is behind advancements in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing (NLP).2\nTwo advancements in deep learning include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs can easily parse visual information, so they’re widely used in image recognition systems. They simulate the way the human brain processes information by breaking down images into components and analyzing them layer by layer to identify patterns and features. RNNs are designed to understand sequential data, so they’re ideally suited for NLP tasks. They can remember previous inputs in the data sequence, which allows them to use predictive analytics to produce contextually informed text—a critical element in speech recognition and the generation of human language.3\nThese two emerging technologies are behind many AI innovations. In image and facial recognition technology, deep learning gives computers the ability to identify objects, faces and scenes with accuracy that rivals human perception, which has applications from medical imaging diagnostics to surveillance. Deep learning in natural language processing has helped develop applications that understand, interpret and generate human speech and language. NLP is behind advancements in voice recognition systems, translation services and conversational AI.3\n\nReinforcement Learning and Autonomous Systems\nReinforcement learning (RL) allows machines or software—often referred to as \"agents\"—to learn to make decisions by trial and error. This process involves an agent interacting with its environment, performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, the agent learns to optimize its actions to maximize cumulative rewards, essentially learning from its experiences much as human beings do.4\nAutonomous systems, particularly self-driving cars and robotics, are real-world applications of reinforcement learning. In self-driving cars, RL algorithms process multiple inputs of sensory data to make real-time decisions during navigation. In robotics, these algorithms allow autonomous robots to adapt to new tasks through interaction, learning how to manipulate objects or navigate environments independently.4\nThe increase in autonomous AI systems raises significant concerns regarding ethical considerations. Delegating important decisions to machines, particularly in situations involving human safety, presents dilemmas concerning accountability, privacy and job displacement. Making sure these systems make ethical decisions, free from biases embedded in their training data, is a big challenge. Engineers must take a balanced approach when designing these systems, considering both their transformative potential and the ethical imperatives to ensure they benefit society as a whole.5\n\nNatural Language Processing Advancements\nAs discussed above, NLP is driven by RNNs. NLP has changed how machines understand and interact with human language. These innovations are behind the development of conversational AI and chatbots that make interactions with digital systems more intuitive and human-like. Sophisticated NLP models let programs comprehend, generate and engage in conversations with users, providing assistance, gathering information and facilitating transactions.6\nNLP is breaking down language barriers across the globe. Modern translation models use deep learning to provide translations that are accurate and capture the nuances and context of the original text. Sentiment analysis, another common use of NLP, allows machines to interpret and categorize opinions from text data. This can help organizations in the business world gain valuable insights into consumer attitudes and feelings.6\nVoice recognition technology is also driven by advancements in NLP. Though such things used to exist only in science fiction, virtual assistants including Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant can now understand and respond to voice commands. Their practical applications include setting reminders and controlling smart home devices, making technology more interactive and accessible.6\n\nExplainable AI and Model Interpretability\nExplainable AI (XAI) and model interpretability address the need for transparency and understanding in AI decision-making processes. As AI models, particularly deep learning networks, have become more complex, their processes appear as \"black boxes,” meaning no one understands how they make decisions. Developers behind XAI are attempting to make these processes transparent so humans can understand, trust and effectively manage AI outcomes.7\nAI models in autonomous driving and in industries such as healthcare and finance can have significant consequences, so people want to understand its decision-making process. XAI provides insights into the reasoning behind AI decisions, so humans can trust that they’re fair, unbiased and aligned with ethical standards.7\nThere is, however, a notable tradeoff between model complexity, accuracy and interpretability. Highly complex models, like deep neural networks, often achieve superior performance but are less interpretable. Simpler models, such as decision trees, offer more interpretability but lack the sophisticated predictive capabilities of their complex counterparts. Balancing accuracy with interpretability requires careful consideration of the model's intended use, the importance of its decisions and the necessity for transparency. Strategies to enhance interpretability include developing models that inherently provide more insight into their decision-making process and using post-hoc analysis tools to interpret complex model outputs.7\n\nHelp Meet the High Demand for Expertise in Engineering\nGain the expertise to solve complex challenges in areas such as non-linear control, optimization, signal processing and systems biology.
